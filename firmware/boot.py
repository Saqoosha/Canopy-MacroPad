Runs once, before code.py, on every hard reset — and only a hard reset,
which is also what re-enumerates USB and so makes a changed CDC layout
visible to the host. Saving this file is not enough: the auto-reload
that follows is a soft reset. Unplug and replug, or `microcontroller.
reset()` from the REPL, which was the path used on the bench.

The whole point of this file: the device must NOT be a keyboard.
