"""The key field's numbers, and the only place they are written.

This file used to be case/params.py's job, derived from the NeoKey and the
4978 breakout. The boards are gone and the copper is ours now, so the PCB
owns the field and the case imports it. Changing the pitch here moves the
sockets, the pixels and the plate holes together, which is the whole point
of the inversion.

Stdlib only, deliberately: case/.venv must be able to import it without
installing anything, and so must a fresh machine.
